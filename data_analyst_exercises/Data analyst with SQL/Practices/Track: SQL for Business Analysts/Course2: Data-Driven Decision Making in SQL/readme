|     In this course, you will learn how to use SQL to support decision making. It is based on a case study about an online movie rental company |
| with a database about customer information, movie ratings, background information on actors and more.                                          |
|     You will learn to apply SQL queries to study for example customer preferences, customer engagement, and sales development.                 |
|     This course also covers SQL extensions for online analytical processing (OLAP), which makes it easier to obtain key insights from          |  
| multidimensional aggregated data.                                                                                                              |

|................................................................................................................................................|
|     The first chapter is an introduction to the use case of an online movie rental company, called MovieNow and focuses on using simple SQL    |
| queries to extract and aggregated data from its database.                                                                                      |

|................................................................................................................................................|
|     More complex queries with GROUP BY, LEFT JOIN and sub-queries are used to gain insight into customer preferences.                          |
|================================================================================================================================================|
|                                   CHAPTER 3. DATA-DRIVEN DECISION MAKING WITH ADVANCED SQL QUERIES.                                            |
|................................................................................................................................................|
|     The concept of nested queries and correlated nested queries is introduced and the functions EXISTS and UNION are used to categorize        |
| customers, movies, actors, and more.                                                                                                           |
|================================================================================================================================================|
|                                     CHAPTER 4. DATA-DRIVEN DECISION MAKING WITH OLAP SQL QUERIES.                                              |
|................................................................................................................................................|
|     The OLAP extensions in SQL are introduced and applied to aggregated data on multiple levels.                                               |
|     These extensions are the CUBE, ROLLUP and GROUPING SETS operators.                                                                         |
