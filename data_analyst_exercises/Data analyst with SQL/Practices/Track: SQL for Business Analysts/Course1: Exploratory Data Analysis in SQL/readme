|     You have access to a database. Now what do you do? Building on your existing skills joining tables, using basic functions, grouping data,  |
| and using subqueries, the next step in your SQL journey is learning how to explore a database and the data in it. Using data from Stack        |
| Overflow, Fortune 500 companies, and 311 help requests from Evanston, IL, you'll get familiar with numeric, character, and date/time data      | 
| types. You'll use functions to aggregate, summarize, and analyze data without leaving the database. Errors and inconsistencies in the data     |
| won't stop you! You'll learn common problems to look for and strategies to clean up messy data. By the end of this course, you'll be ready to  |
| start exploring your own PostgreSQL databases and analyzing the data in them.                                                                  |

|                                                     CHAPTER 1. WHAT'S IN THE DATABASE?                                                         |
|................................................................................................................................................|
|     Start exploring a database by identifying the tables and the foreign keys that link them. Look for missing values, count the number of     |
| observations, and join tables to understand how they're related. Learn about coalescing and casting data along the way.                        |

|                                               CHAPTER 2. SUMMARIZING & AGGREGATING NUMERIC DATA.                                               |
|................................................................................................................................................|
|     You'll build on functions like min and max to summarize numeric data in new ways. Add average, variance, correlation, and percentile       |
| functions to your toolkit, and learn how to truncate and round numeric values too. Build complex queries and save your results by creating     | 
| temporary tables.                                                                                                                              |

|                                            CHAPTER 3. EXPLORING CATEGORICAL DATA & UNSTRUCTERED TEXT.                                          |
|................................................................................................................................................|
|     Text, or character, data can get messy, but you'll learn how to deal with inconsistencies in case, spacing, and delimiters. Learn how to   |
| use a temporary table to recode messy categorical data to standardized values you can count and aggregate. Extract new variables from the      |
| unstructured text as you explore help requests submitted to the city of Evanston, IL.                                                          |

|................................................................................................................................................|
|     What time is it? In this chapter, you'll learn how to find out. You'll aggregate date/time data by hour, day, month, or year and practice  | 
| both constructing time series and finding gaps in them.                                                                                        |
