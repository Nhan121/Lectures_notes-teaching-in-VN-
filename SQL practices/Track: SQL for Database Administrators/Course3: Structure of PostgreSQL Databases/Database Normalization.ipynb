    "#### Exercise 2.1. Simplifying database records\n",
    "One teacher from the high school heard rumblings about efforts to better organize student records. He would like to organize `student grades` in his `courses`. The teacher proposes the following table structure for the `test_grades` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "                    CREATE TABLE test_grades(\n",
    "                                                student_id INTEGER NOT NULL,\n",
    "                                                course_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n",

    "Each record represents a student from one of the teacher's classes identified by the student's id, the course name, and the student's test grades. \n",
    "\n",
    "The teacher finds that managing the database with this structure is difficult. Inserting new grades requires a complex `query`. In addition, doing calculations on the grades is not very easy. In this exercise, you will help to put this table in `1st Normal Form (1NF)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions\n",
    "Define a new version of the table with the name `test_grade`.\n",

    "                                    );\n",
    "**Comments.** This new table design will make it possible to easily add new `test grades` for each `student`. Performing `queries` to calculate statistics like the average test score or the lowest test score will be enabled by this design. Your excellent work shows how satisfying `1NF` improves the use and organization of the teacher's data."
