The role of a data scientist is to turn raw data into actionable insights. 
Much of the world's raw data—from electronic medical records to customer transaction histories—lives in organized collections of tables called relational databases. 
To be an effective data scientist, you must know how to wrangle and extract data from these databases using a language called SQL .

This kernel_chapter provides a brief introduction to working with relational databases. 
We'll learn about their structure, how to talk about them using database lingo, and how to begin an analysis using simple SQL commands to select and summarize columns from database tables.
