# DESCRIPTION
## PART I.
- After all of the hard work of acquiring data and getting them into a form you can work with, you ultimately want to make clear, succinct conclusions from them. This crucial last step of a data analysis pipeline hinges on the principles of statistical inference. 
- In this `PART`, you will start building the foundation you need to think statistically, speak the language of your data, and understand what your data is telling you. 
- The foundations of statistical thinking took decades to build, but can be grasped much faster today with the help of computers. 
- With the power of `Python-based tools`, you will rapidly get up-to-speed and begin thinking statistically by the end of this course.
### Chapter 1. Graphical exploratory data analysis
Before diving into sophisticated statistical inference techniques, you should first explore your data by plotting them and computing simple summary statistics. This process, called exploratory data analysis, is a crucial first step in statistical analysis of data.
### Chapter 2. Quantitative exploratory data analysis
In this chapter, you will compute useful summary statistics, which serve to concisely describe salient features of a dataset with a few numbers.
### Chapter 3. Thinking probabilistically-- Discrete variables.
Statistical inference rests upon probability. Because we can very rarely say anything meaningful with absolute certainty from data, we use probabilistic language to make quantitative statements about data. In this chapter, you will learn how to think probabilistically about discrete quantities: those that can only take certain values, like integers.
### Chapter 4. Thinking probabilistically-- Continuous variables.
Itâ€™s time to move onto continuous variables, such as those that can take on any fractional value. Many of the principles are the same, but there are some subtleties. At the end of this final chapter, you will be speaking the probabilistic language you need to launch into the inference techniques covered in the sequel to this course.

## PART II.
- After completing `Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1)`, you have the probabilistic mindset and foundational hacker stats skills to dive into data sets and extract useful information from them. 
- In this `PART`, you will do just that, expanding and honing your `hacker stats toolbox` to perform the two key tasks in `statistical inference`, `parameter estimation` and `hypothesis testing`. 
- You will work with real data sets as you learn, culminating with analysis of measurements of the beaks of the `Darwin's famous finches`. You will emerge from this course with new knowledge and lots of practice under your belt, ready to attack your own inference problems out in the world.
### Chapter 1. Parameter estimation by optimization
When doing statistical inference, we speak the language of probability. 
- A `probability distribution` that describes your data has parameters. 
- So, a major goal of `statistical inference` is to `estimate the values` of these `parameters`, which allows us to concisely and unambiguously describe our data and draw conclusions from it. 

In this chapter, you will learn how to find the optimal parameters, those that best describe your data.
### Chapter 2. Bootstrap confidence intervals
To `"pull yourself up by your bootstraps"` is a classic idiom meaning that you achieve a difficult task by yourself with no help at all. 
- In `statistical inference`, you want to know what would happen if you could repeat your data acquisition an infinite number of times. 
- This task is impossible, but can we use only the data we actually have to get close to the same result as an infinitude of experiments? 
- The answer is yes! The technique to do it is aptly called `bootstrapping`. 

This chapter will introduce you to this extraordinarily powerful tool.
