Map() and lambda functions\nSo far, you've used lambda functions to write short, simple functions as well as to redefine functions with simple functionality. The best use case for `lambda functions`, however, are for when you want these simple functionalities to be anonymously embedded within larger expressions. What that means is that the functionality is not stored in the environment, unlike a function defined with def. To understand this idea better, you will use a `lambda function` in the context of the `map()` function.\n\nRecall from the video that map() applies a function over an object, such as a list. Here, you can use lambda functions to define the function that `map()` will use to process the object. For example:\n\n        nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n\n        result = map(lambda a: a ** 2, nums)\nYou can see here that a lambda function, which raises a value a to the power of 2, is passed to `map()` alongside a list of numbers, nums. The map object that results from the call to `map()` is stored in result. You will now practice the use of lambda functions with `map()`. \n\nFor this exercise, you will map the functionality of the `add_bangs()` function you defined in previous exercises over a list of strings.\n#### SOLUTION."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create a list of strings: spells\nspells = [\"protego\", \"accio\", \"expecto patronum\", \"legilimens\"]\n\n# Use map() to apply a lambda function over spells: shout_spells\nshout_spells = map(lambda item: item + '!!!', spells)\n\n# Convert shout_spells to a list: shout_spells_list\nshout_spells_list = list(shout_spells)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(shout_spells_list)","execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"['protego!!!', 'accio!!!', 'expecto patronum!!!', 'legilimens!!!']\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Exercise 1.2.4.

Error handling with try-except\nA good practice in writing your own functions is also anticipating the ways in which other people (or yourself, if you accidentally misuse your own function) might use the function you defined.\n\nAs in the previous exercise, you saw that the `len()` function is able to handle input arguments such as strings, lists, and tuples, but not int type ones and raises an appropriate error and error message when it encounters invalid input arguments. One way of doing this is through exception handling with the try-except block.\n\nIn this exercise, you will define a function as well as use a try-except block for handling cases when incorrect input arguments are passed to the function.\n\nRecall the `shout_echo()` function you defined in previous exercises; parts of the function definition are provided in the sample code. Your goal is to complete the exception handling code in the function definition and provide an appropriate error message when raising an error.\n\n#### SOLUTION."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define shout_echo\ndef shout_echo(word1, echo=1):\n    \"\"\"Concatenate echo copies of word1 and three\n    exclamation marks at the end of the string.\"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize empty strings: echo_word, shout_words\n    echo_word = ''\n    shout_words = ''\n\n    # Add exception handling with try-except\n    try:\n        # Concatenate echo copies of word1 using *: echo_word\n        echo_word = word1 * echo\n\n        # Concatenate '!!!' to echo_word: shout_words\n        shout_words = echo_word + '!!!'\n    except:\n        # Print error message\n        print(\"word1 must be a string and echo must be an integer.\")\n\n    # Return shout_words\n    return shout_words\n\n# Call shout_echo\nshout_echo(\"particle\", echo=\"accelerator\")","execution_count":23,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"word1 must be a string and echo must be an integer.\n","name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":23,"data":{"text/plain":"''"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Exercise 2.2.3. Error handling by raising an error\nAnother way to raise an error is by using raise. In this exercise, you will add a raise statement to the `shout_echo()` function you defined before to raise an error message when the value supplied by the user to the echo argument is less than 0.\n\nThe call to `shout_echo()` uses valid argument values. To test and see how the raise statement works, simply change the value for the echo argument to a negative value.
