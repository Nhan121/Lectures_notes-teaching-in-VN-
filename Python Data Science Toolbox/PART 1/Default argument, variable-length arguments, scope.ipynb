Theory\n####  Crash course on scope in functions\nWe'll now talk about the idea of scope in the context of `user-defined functions`. You've been defining variables in your programs and so far, you've been using these variables without any problems. However, one thing you should know is that not all objects that you define are always accessible everywhere in a program. Enter the idea of scope, which tells you which part of a program an object or a name may be accessed. \n\n`Names` refer to the variables or, more generally, objects such as functions that are defined in your program, for example, a variable `x` has a name, as does the function `sum`. \n\nThere are three types of scope that you should know. \n>- The first one is the idea of the **global scope**. A name that is in the global scope means that it is *defined in the main body of a script or a `Python program`*. \n>- The second one, is the **local scope**. A name that is in a local scope means that it is **defined within a function**. Once the `execution` of a function is done, any name inside the local scope ceases to exist, which means you **cannot access those names anymore outside of the `function`** definition. \n>- The third is something called the **built-in scope**: this consists of names in the pre-defined built-ins module `Python` provides, such as `print` and `sum`. \n\nYou'll play around with the built-ins module in the interactive exercises."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Global vs. local scope (1)\nLet's look at a couple of examples to clarify these definitions.
