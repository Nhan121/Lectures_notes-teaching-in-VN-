    "#### Definition.\n",
    "A **`Lambda Function`** in **`Python programming`** is an `anonymous function` or a function having `no name`. It is a small and restricted function having no more than one line. Just like a `normal function`, a `Lambda function` can have multiple arguments with one expression.\n",
    "#### Structure.\n",
    "In **`Python`**, `lambda expressions` (or lambda forms) are utilized to `construct anonymous functions`. To do so, you will use the `lambda keyword` (just as you use def to define normal functions). Every `anonymous function` you define in `Python` will have 3 essential parts:\n",
    "- The `lambda keyword`.\n",
    "- The `parameters` (or bound variables), and\n",
    "- The `function body`.\n",

    "                    lambda params_1, params_2 : expression\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here, `params_1` and `params_2` are the parameters (the 2nd part) which are passed to the `lambda function`. You can add as many or few parameters as you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `Expression (or function body)` is the 3rd part is any valid python expression that operates on the parameters you provide to the function; that describe the purpose of the `anonymous function.` \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comments & remarks\n",
    "- However, notice that we do not use `brackets ()` around the `parameters` as we do with `regular functions`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A `lambda function` can have any number of `parameters`, but the `function body` can only contain `one expression`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Moreover, a `lambda` is written in a `single line of code` and can also be **`invoked immediately`**. You will see all this in action in the upcoming examples.\n",
